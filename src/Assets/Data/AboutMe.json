    "bio":"I am a recent 2020 graduate from City, University of London that has completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have experience with the programming languages Python, Java and C++ as well as knowledge with SQLite and UML. I have completed multiple projects from past coursework to independent personal projects which can be found on my GitHub and I am very passionate about computer science having academically studied the subject since 2014 and Iâ€™m always looking to learn more.",

The simulation was node based so accurate volume had to be calculated to determine physical properties such as buoyancy, to solve this I made a system to determine what the volume of a particular node by analysing each of its neighbours. As a result, I managed to get a relatively accurate buoyancy system working for each node which would allow the ship to be flooded."],

As a result, we managed to achieve 76% overall for the module."],
